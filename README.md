# learning_log project to get to know Django

We’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic.
The Learning Log home page should describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
